I was talking to Lucky225 about this so I guess I'll post it here. I was doing some exchange scanning in NY for my article, and I was getting bored so I decided to try the same format for the verification # (npa-nxx-9901) in a Utah area code. So I picked a random prefix and I got a dialtone. I figured it was a coded extender but I dialed an 800 # anyway, and it went through! I called back and dialed an MCI anac (1800 444-4444), and it read back the Utah number that I had dialed. I wanted to see if it was a pots line so I dialed 1800 555-1140 to get the II digits. Instead of reading back the Utah number, it read back MY home number. I dialed every anac I could think of with this #, and each time it would read back the Utah number, except 1800 555-1140 and 1180 would always read back my number. I was really confused so I went to the store and picked up a pre-paid calling card. I knew the ANI for this particular calling card, so I wanted to see what would happen if I called the Utah dialtone # with it, and then dialed some various anac's. I expected the 555-1140 to "see through" the Utah #, and read back the ANI of the calling card, but it didn't. It read back the Utah number, with 00 as the ANI II digits.
This is apparantly the difference between real-time ANI, flex ANI and the BTN. If you want to know more about this, I'm sure that Lucky can explain it better than I can. And if you want to play with this yourself, just call 1(435) 723-9901. Keep in mind that you can only call 8-0-0 #'s with this, not 888, 877, or 866. Thats probably because it is old and was around before those toll-free exchanges existed.
